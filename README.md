## Generated Code

To create the web app specified in your brief, you will need to create several files, each containing specific content. Here's how you can structure and create each file:

### 1. `ashravan.txt`
Write a short story based on the provided prompt, ensuring it is between 300-400 words.

```txt
After Shai's remarkable restoration, Ashravan awoke with a gasp, his mind flooded with the vivid awareness of his surroundings. The air felt different, charged with a new purpose. The stroke had robbed him of time, but Shai's artistry had given him a second chance. He was determined to seize it.

At first, the palace seemed eerily silent. Each step he took echoed with the gravity of his return. His advisors, once distant and cautious, now approached with renewed respect and curiosity. Ashravan, however, was drawn not to politics, but to the mysteries of his own mind. Shai had left traces of her presence, subtle hints that whispered to him in moments of quiet reflection.

As days turned into weeks, Ashravan's dreams grew more intense. He saw visions of his empire's future, both glorious and terrifying. One night, the dream became a nightmareâ€”a shadowy figure threatened the peace he had worked so hard to restore. Waking in a cold sweat, Ashravan realized the danger wasn't just a figment of his imagination.

Driven by a newfound clarity, he summoned his advisors and shared his vision. Some were skeptical, others intrigued. But Ashravan's conviction was unshakeable. He proposed a radical change, a new path for the empire that would ensure its survival against unseen threats.

The climax came during a grand assembly, where Ashravan, with a voice steady and resolute, laid out his plan. The hall buzzed with tension, the weight of his words hanging in the air. As he spoke, Ashravan felt Shai's influence guiding him, her artistry not just in his soul but in his very being. The assembly was divided, but Ashravan's resolve won them over. The empire would change, evolve, and thrive.

Ashravan stood victorious, not just over the challenges of his rule, but over the doubts of his own heart. Shai had not only restored his life but transformed it. And with that transformation, the empire would march toward a brighter, united future.

    },
    "case_2": {
        "swerve": true,
